## Gene_Chip

This is the project for Artificial Intelligence course.  
It's the investigation for the connection between the gene and the disease state.  
The dataset is 

* classical methods includes logistical regression, support vector machine and K-NN algorithm.  
* deep learning method uses a 4-layer fully connected neural network.  

The final classical accuracy is almost 93%.
